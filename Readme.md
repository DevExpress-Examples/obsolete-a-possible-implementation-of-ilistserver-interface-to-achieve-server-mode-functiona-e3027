# OBSOLETE: A possible implementation of IListServer interface to achieve Server Mode functionality in the GridView extension


<p><strong>Starting with version 12.2, this approach is obsolete.</strong> It is necessary to use the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument14321"><u>Custom Data Binding</u></a> instead.<br />
The following Code Central examples illustrate this feature in action:<br />

<a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E4398">E4398: How to implement a custom binding scenario for two GridViews used in a master-detail relationship with paging and sorting operations</a></p><p>The example demonstrates how to implement the IListServer interface to provide the Server Mode functionality for the MVC GridView Extension.</p>
